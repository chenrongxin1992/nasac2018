					<h4>2. Lionel Briand:Testing Security and Privacy Requirements</h4>

                    <p class=''>Abstract. To facilitate communication among stakeholders, software security and privacy (S&P) requirements are typically written in natural language and capture both positive requirements (i.e., what the system is supposed to do to ensure S&P) and negative requirements (i.e., undesirable behavior undermining S&P). An important question is how to test a system to ensure the conformance of a system with its S&P requirements and, further, how to do that in a systematic, automated, and effective way.
                    </p>
                    <p class=''>This talk will present both (1) Restricted Misuse Case Modeling (RMCM), a use case specification approach to capture S&P requirements, and (2) Misuse Case Programming (MCP), an approach to automatically generate security test cases from RMCM requirements. MCP relies on natural language processing techniques to extract relevant concepts (e.g., inputs and activities) appearing in requirements specifications and generates executable test cases by matching the extracted concepts to a provided test driver API. Further, the talk will briefly touch upon attack generation strategies driven by Artificial Intelligence techniques such as machine learning and metaheuristic search.

Briand is professor in software verification and validation at the SnT centre for Security, Reliability, and Trust, University of Luxembourg, where he is also the vice-director of the centre. He is currently running multiple collaborative research projects with companies in the automotive, satellite, financial, and legal domains. Lionel has held various engineering, academic, and leading research positions in five other countries before that. 
					</p>
					<p class=''>Lionel was elevated to the grade of IEEE Fellow in 2010 for his work on the testing of object-oriented systems. He was granted the IEEE Computer Society Harlan Mills award and the IEEE Reliability Society engineer-of-the-year award for his work on model-based verification and testing, respectively in 2012 and 2013. He received an ERC Advanced grant in 2016 — on the topic of modelling and testing cyber-physical systems — which is the most prestigious individual research grant in the European Union. His research interests include: software testing and verification, model-driven software development, search-based software engineering, and empirical software engineering.

					<h4>3、Yuanyuan Zhou : Oops, I open up the system permission to everyone by accident</h4>
					<p class=''><strong>Abstract:</strong> Access-control protection is a widely used security mechanism with decades of history. Unfortunately as computer systems become ever-so complex, managing access-control related configuration has become a daunting and error prone task for system administrators (sysadmins). Very often, in order to fix some denied access cases for legitimate users, sysadmins accidentally open accesses to many other users unintentionally, leaving a large security hole that can go unnoticed for months until being exploited by malicious users, as reported by many news reports on such security incidents.
					</p>
					<p>In my talk, I will present our recent quantitative study on real-world practices of resolving access-denied issues, with a particular focus on how and why security misconfigurations are introduced during problem solving. We characterize the real-world security misconfigurations introduced in the field, and show that many of these misconfigurations were the results of trial-and-error practices commonly adopted by sysadmins to work around access denials. We argue that the lack of ad- equate feedback information is one fundamental reason that prevents sysadmins from developing precise understanding and thus induces trial and error. Our study on access-denied messages shows that many of today’s software systems miss the opportunities for providing adequate feedback information, imposing unnecessary obstacles to correct resolutions. At the end, I will also briefly present a couple of our on-going work in addressing this problem.
